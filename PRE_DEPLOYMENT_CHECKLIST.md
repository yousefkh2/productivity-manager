- [ ] `frontend/.env.example` exists
- [ ] `backend/Dockerfile` exists
- [ ] `frontend/Dockerfile` exists
- [ ] `frontend/nginx.conf` exists

## âœ… Testing Locally

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
go run main.go

# Test health check
curl http://localhost:8080/health
# Should return: {"status":"ok"}
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
npm run preview

# Visit http://localhost:4173
# Should load app and connect to backend
```

### Integration
```bash
# Start both services
cd /home/yousef/Desktop/Project/hardmode-pomo
./start-web.sh

# Test full flow:
# 1. Open http://localhost:5173
# 2. Create a task
# 3. Start timer
# 4. Complete pomodoro
# 5. Check data persists after refresh
```

## âœ… Environment Variables

### Backend (.do/app.yaml)
```yaml
envs:
  - key: PORT
    value: "8080"
  - key: ENV
    value: "production"
```

### Frontend (.do/app.yaml)
```yaml
envs:
  - key: VITE_API_URL
    value: "https://backend-xxxxx.ondigitalocean.app"  # Update after backend deployed!
```

## âœ… Security

- [ ] No hardcoded passwords
- [ ] No API keys in code
- [ ] `.env` files in `.gitignore`
- [ ] CORS configured for production domain
- [ ] SQL injection protection (using prepared statements)
- [ ] Input validation on backend

## âœ… Database

Choose one:
- [ ] **Option A**: SQLite with persistent volume
- [ ] **Option B**: Managed PostgreSQL database ($15/mo extra)

For SQLite:
- [ ] Volume path configured: `/app/data`
- [ ] Database file path: `/app/data/hardmode.db`

## âœ… Cost Understanding

Before deploying, you understand:
- [ ] Basic setup costs $8/month
- [ ] $200 credit = 25 months free
- [ ] Can upgrade/downgrade anytime
- [ ] Can delete app to stop charges
- [ ] Unused credit expires after 60 days

## âœ… Deployment Method Chosen

Pick one:

### Option 1: App Platform (Recommended)
- [ ] Easiest to set up
- [ ] Auto-deploy from GitHub
- [ ] Managed infrastructure
- [ ] $8/month
- **â†’ Use Web UI or CLI**

### Option 2: Droplet + Docker
- [ ] More control
- [ ] Learn Linux/DevOps
- [ ] Manual setup required
- [ ] $6/month
- **â†’ Use SSH + Docker**

## âœ… Ready to Deploy!

All boxes checked? Great! Choose your deployment method:

### Web UI (Easiest):
1. Open `QUICK_DEPLOY.md`
2. Follow "Option 1: Web UI"
3. Deploy in 5 minutes!

### CLI (Advanced):
```bash
# Install doctl
brew install doctl  # or snap install doctl

# Authenticate
doctl auth init

# Deploy
./deploy.sh
```

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues

### "Build failed"
- Check `package.json` has `"build": "vite build"`
- Make sure all dependencies in `package.json`
- Run `npm run build` locally first

### "Cannot connect to backend"
- Check `VITE_API_URL` is set correctly
- Verify backend URL is correct
- Check browser console for CORS errors

### "Database not persisting"
- Add volume in App Platform settings
- Path: `/app/data`
- Size: 1GB minimum

### "Port already in use"
- Make sure `PORT` env variable is `8080`
- Check backend listens on correct port
