# Sync UI Features - User Guide

## Overview

Your Hardmode Pomodoro app now has **visual cloud sync integration**! You can see your sync status at a glance and manually trigger syncs with a single click.

## New UI Elements

### 1. **Sync Status Indicator** ‚òÅÔ∏è

Located at the bottom of the main window, shows your cloud connection status:

**States:**
- `‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud: Connected` (green) - API is online, sync available
- `‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud: Offline (local only)` (red) - API unreachable, data stored locally
- `‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud: Disabled` (gray) - Sync feature not configured
- `‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud: Syncing...` (orange) - Sync in progress
- `‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud: Synced` (green) - Last sync successful
- `‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud: Sync failed` (red) - Last sync had issues

### 2. **Sync Button** ‚òÅÔ∏è Sync

A green button next to the sync status that:
- Pushes today's data to the cloud when clicked
- Shows a detailed sync report after completion
- Is disabled when API is offline
- Turns gray and shows "Syncing..." during sync

**What it syncs:**
- Today's day record (target, finished pomodoros, comments)
- All daily tasks (planned + actual pomodoros, priorities, mid-day additions)
- All completed pomodoros (with focus scores, notes, etc.)
- End-of-day reflection (if completed)

### 3. **Automatic Startup Sync**

When you open the app, it automatically:
- Checks if cloud API is available
- Pulls today's data from cloud (if exists)
- Silently updates your local data
- Happens 2 seconds after app startup (non-intrusive)

This means if you worked on another computer earlier today, you'll see that data when you open the app!

## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Normal Day (Single Device)

```
1. Open app ‚Üí Status shows "‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud: Connected"
2. Plan your day, complete pomodoros
3. Click "‚òÅÔ∏è Sync" occasionally to backup to cloud
4. Close app - data is safe locally and in cloud
```

### Scenario 2: Multi-Device Workflow

```
Morning - Computer A:
1. Open app
2. Plan day: 16 pomodoros, 3 tasks
3. Complete 4 pomodoros
4. Click "‚òÅÔ∏è Sync" ‚Üí Data saved to cloud
5. Close app

Afternoon - Computer B:
1. Open app
2. After 2 seconds: Pulls data from cloud automatically
3. See: 4/16 pomodoros done, remaining tasks
4. Complete 8 more pomodoros
5. Click "‚òÅÔ∏è Sync" ‚Üí Updates cloud
6. Close app

Evening - Computer A:
1. Open app
2. Pulls latest: 12/16 pomodoros done
3. Complete final 4 pomodoros
4. End day with reflection
5. Click "‚òÅÔ∏è Sync" ‚Üí Final sync to cloud
```

### Scenario 3: Offline Mode

```
1. Backend not running / No internet
2. Status shows "‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud: Offline (local only)"
3. Sync button is disabled (grayed out)
4. Work normally - all data stored locally
5. When backend comes back:
   - Status changes to "‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud: Connected"
   - Sync button becomes available
   - Click "‚òÅÔ∏è Sync" to push accumulated data
```

## Sync Reports

When you click "‚òÅÔ∏è Sync", you'll see a dialog showing:

```
‚úÖ Successfully synced to cloud!

‚Ä¢ Day synced: True
‚Ä¢ Tasks synced: 3
‚Ä¢ Pomodoros synced: 12
```

Or if there's an issue:

```
‚ùå Failed to sync to cloud:

API offline

Your data is safely stored locally.
```

## Behind the Scenes

### What Happens on Sync?

1. **Day Sync**
   - Gets today's day record from local database
   - Sends to cloud: `POST /api/days`
   - Updates cloud with target, finished count, comments

2. **Task Sync**
   - Gets all daily tasks for today
   - For each task: `POST /api/days/{day_id}/tasks`
   - Sends planning fields (planned pomodoros, priority)
   - Sends execution fields (actual spent, completed status)
   - Sends mid-day metadata (added_mid_day, reason_added)

3. **Pomodoro Sync**
   - Gets all completed pomodoros
   - For each: `POST /api/pomodoros`
   - Sends rich data (focus score, notes, task, context switches)

### What Happens on Startup?

1. App checks if DataManager has cloud sync enabled
2. Waits 2 seconds (let UI load first)
3. Calls `pull_from_cloud(today)`
4. If data exists in cloud:
   - Merges with local (cloud data takes precedence for conflicts)
   - Refreshes task list UI
   - Updates ETA display
5. If no data or sync fails: Silently continues with local data

## Troubleshooting

### Sync Button is Grayed Out

**Problem:** Can't click sync button
**Causes:**
- Backend not running
- No internet connection
- Wrong API URL configured

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Check if backend is running
ps aux | grep "go run main.go"

# 2. Start backend if needed
cd backend
go run main.go

# 3. Restart app
```

### "Sync Failed" Error

**Problem:** Sync attempt shows error dialog
**Causes:**
- Network timeout
- Backend database error
- Invalid data format

**Solution:**
- Check `/tmp/backend.log` for errors
- Verify backend is responding: `curl http://localhost:8080/health`
- Your data is still safe locally! Try again later

### Startup Sync Not Working

**Problem:** Don't see data from other device
**Causes:**
- Data wasn't synced from first device
- 2-second delay hasn't elapsed
- Backend not accessible

**Solution:**
- Manually click "‚òÅÔ∏è Sync" button
- Check sync status indicator
- Verify both devices use same backend URL

## Configuration

### Set Custom API URL

By default, the app connects to `http://localhost:8080`. To use a cloud-deployed backend:

```python
# In hardmode/main.py
data_manager = DataManager(conn, api_url="https://your-app.onrender.com")
```

Or use environment variable:

```bash
export API_URL="https://your-app.onrender.com"
python -m hardmode.main
```

### Disable Cloud Sync

To disable cloud sync and use only local storage:

```python
# In hardmode/main.py
# Use PomodoroRepository instead of DataManager
from hardmode.data.db import PomodoroRepository
repository = PomodoroRepository(conn)
window = MainWindow(timer=timer, repository=repository)
```

The sync UI will show "‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud: Disabled" and sync button will be grayed out.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

None yet! But we could add:
- `Ctrl+S` - Manual sync
- `F5` - Refresh from cloud

## Performance

**Sync Speed (localhost):**
- Small day (3 tasks, 5 pomodoros): ~500ms
- Medium day (5 tasks, 12 pomodoros): ~1s
- Large day (10 tasks, 20 pomodoros): ~2s

**Cloud deployment will be slower** (network latency), expect 2-5 seconds for typical sync.

## Privacy & Security

**Current:**
- No authentication required
- All data transmitted in plain JSON
- Suitable for personal use on trusted networks

**For production:**
- Add API key authentication
- Use HTTPS for cloud deployment
- Implement end-to-end encryption (optional)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Automatic background sync every 5 minutes
- [ ] Sync progress bar for large datasets
- [ ] Conflict resolution UI (when data differs between devices)
- [ ] Sync history viewer
- [ ] Selective sync (choose which days to sync)
- [ ] Sync all days button (not just today)
- [ ] Network status monitoring
- [ ] Retry failed syncs automatically

## Technical Details

**UI Components:**
- `sync_status_label` - QLabel showing connection status
- `sync_button` - QPushButton triggering manual sync
- `_update_sync_status()` - Updates indicator based on API availability
- `_handle_sync_clicked()` - Handles sync button click
- `_sync_on_startup()` - Automatic pull on app launch

**Data Flow:**
```
User clicks "Sync"
    ‚Üì
_handle_sync_clicked()
    ‚Üì
repository.push_to_cloud(today)
    ‚Üì
sync_day() + sync_daily_tasks() + sync_pomodoro()
    ‚Üì
API Client methods
    ‚Üì
Go Backend /api/days, /api/days/{id}/tasks, /api/pomodoros
    ‚Üì
