# Day Archival Feature

## Overview
When a user completes their day reflection, the entire workspace becomes **read-only** to preserve the integrity of the completed day's record. This prevents accidental modifications to historical data.

## Visual Design

### 🌙 **Archived Day Overlay**
When a day is marked complete (has reflection saved):
- **Semi-transparent dark overlay** (60% black with backdrop blur) covers the timer and task areas
- **Centered modal card** displays archival status
- **Purple theme** with moon icon indicates completion
- **Two action buttons**:
  - "View Reflection" - Opens the End Day dialog to view/edit reflection
  - "View Analytics" - Switches to analytics tab

### 📍 **Status Indicators**
1. **Header Badge**: Purple "Day Complete" badge with moon icon appears next to the date
2. **Button State**: "End Day" button transforms to "View Reflection" with purple styling
3. **Disabled Controls**: All interactive elements are visually dimmed (50% opacity)

## Disabled Features

When `dayData.day_rating` exists (day is complete):

### Timer Component
- ❌ Play/Pause button disabled
- ❌ Reset button disabled
- ❌ Mode switch button disabled
- ⚠️ Timer automatically stops if running when day is completed

### Task List Component
- ❌ Add Task button hidden
- ❌ Task completion checkboxes disabled (cannot check/uncheck)
- ❌ Delete task buttons hidden
- ❌ Task selection disabled (cannot select different tasks)
- ❌ New task form hidden

### Header Actions
- ❌ "Plan Day" button disabled with tooltip: "Day is complete and archived."

## Technical Implementation

### Props Added
```jsx
// Timer component
<Timer disabled={!!dayData?.day_rating} />

// TaskList component
<TaskList disabled={!!dayData?.day_rating} />
```

### Overlay Component (App.jsx)
```jsx
{dayData?.day_rating && (
  <motion.div className="absolute inset-0 bg-black/60 backdrop-blur-sm rounded-2xl">
    {/* Archival message and action buttons */}
  </motion.div>
)}
```

### Auto-stop Timer
Timer automatically pauses when `disabled` prop becomes true:
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (disabled && isRunning) {
    setIsRunning(false);
  }
}, [disabled]);
```

## User Experience Flow

### Completing a Day
1. User clicks "End Day"
2. Fills out satisfaction rating (1-10) and reflection
3. Clicks "Save & Rest 🌙"
4. Success alert: "✓ Day reflection saved! Great work today. 🌙"
5. **Interface transforms**:
   - Overlay appears with archival message
   - All controls become disabled
   - Badge appears in header
   - Button text changes to "View Reflection"

### Viewing Archived Day
- Users can still see their completed work
- Analytics remain fully accessible
- Reflection can be viewed and updated if needed
- Historical integrity is preserved

## Best Practices Followed

✅ **Visual Hierarchy**: Overlay clearly communicates the locked state  
✅ **Graceful Degradation**: Interface remains viewable, just not editable  
✅ **Clear Feedback**: Multiple visual indicators of completion status  
✅ **Action Guidance**: Overlay provides clear next actions (view reflection/analytics)  
✅ **Data Integrity**: Prevents accidental modification of completed records  
✅ **Accessibility**: Disabled states use proper `disabled` attribute and cursor changes  

## Database Check

To verify which days have been completed:
```bash
sqlite3 backend/hardmode.db "SELECT date, day_rating, reflection_notes FROM day WHERE day_rating IS NOT NULL;"
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] "Reopen Day" feature for exceptional cases (with confirmation)
- [ ] Show completion timestamp in overlay
- [ ] Archive badge color changes based on satisfaction rating
- [ ] Summary statistics in the overlay (e.g., "8/10 rating, 12 pomos completed")
