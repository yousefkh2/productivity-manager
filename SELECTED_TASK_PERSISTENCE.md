# 📌 Selected Task Persistence

## Overview
The selected task now persists across page refreshes! When you refresh, the same task you were working on stays selected.

## How It Works

### Save to localStorage
When you select a task, it saves:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('selectedTaskId', taskId.toString());
localStorage.setItem('selectedTaskDate', currentDate);
```

### Restore on Load
When the page loads:
1. **Check if it's the same day** (don't restore yesterday's task)
2. **Load saved task ID** from localStorage
3. **Validate task still exists** in today's task list
4. **Keep selection** or auto-select first incomplete

### Smart Validation

```javascript
// On page load
const savedDate = localStorage.getItem('selectedTaskDate');
const today = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];

if (savedDate === today) {
  // Same day - restore saved task
  const savedTaskId = parseInt(localStorage.getItem('selectedTaskId'), 10);
  
  // Verify task still exists
  const taskExists = tasks.find(t => t.id === savedTaskId);
  
  if (taskExists) {
    // ✅ Keep saved selection
  } else {
    // ❌ Task was deleted, select first incomplete
  }
} else {
  // Different day - clear old selection
  localStorage.removeItem('selectedTaskId');
  localStorage.removeItem('selectedTaskDate');
}
```

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Normal Refresh (Same Task)
```
Before refresh:
- Selected: "Write code"
- Timer: 20:00 (running)

After refresh:
- Selected: "Write code" ✅ (same!)
- Timer: ~20:00 (still running)
```

### Scenario 2: Task Was Deleted
```
Before refresh:
- Selected: Task ID 42 ("Old task")

[Task gets deleted by another session]

After refresh:
- Task ID 42 doesn't exist
- Auto-selects first incomplete task instead ✅
```

### Scenario 3: New Day
```
Yesterday:
- Selected: "Yesterday's task"
- Saved to localStorage

Today (new day):
- Yesterday's selection cleared
- Auto-selects first incomplete from today ✅
```

### Scenario 4: No Tasks Yet
```
On refresh:
- No tasks exist
- selectedTaskId = null ✅
- Will auto-select when first task added
```

## Benefits

### ✅ Seamless Experience
- Refresh doesn't interrupt your workflow
- Timer + Task selection both persist
- No need to re-select your task

### ✅ Cross-Session Safe
- Validates task still exists
- Handles deleted tasks gracefully
- Clears stale data from previous days

### ✅ Smart Defaults
- Falls back to first incomplete if saved task gone
- New day = fresh start
- Null selection if no tasks

## Implementation Details

### State Initialization
```javascript
const [selectedTaskId, setSelectedTaskId] = useState(() => {
  const savedDate = localStorage.getItem('selectedTaskDate');
  const today = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
  
  if (savedDate === today) {
    const saved = localStorage.getItem('selectedTaskId');
    return saved ? parseInt(saved, 10) : null;
  }
  
  return null;
});
```

### Persistence Effect
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (selectedTaskId !== null) {
    localStorage.setItem('selectedTaskId', selectedTaskId.toString());
    localStorage.setItem('selectedTaskDate', currentDate);
  } else {
    localStorage.removeItem('selectedTaskId');
    localStorage.removeItem('selectedTaskDate');
  }
}, [selectedTaskId, currentDate]);
```

### Validation on Data Load
```javascript
const loadDayData = async () => {
  const tasksData = await api.getDailyTasks(day.id);
  
  if (tasksData && tasksData.length > 0) {
    const savedTaskExists = selectedTaskId && 
                           tasksData.find(t => t.id === selectedTaskId);
    
    if (!savedTaskExists) {
      // Saved task doesn't exist - select first incomplete
      const firstIncomplete = tasksData.find(t => !t.is_completed);
      if (firstIncomplete) {
        setSelectedTaskId(firstIncomplete.id);
      }
    }
  }
};
```

## Edge Cases Handled

### ✅ Task Deleted While Away
- Validates task exists in loaded task list
- Falls back to first incomplete task
- No errors or broken selection

### ✅ Different Day
- Checks saved date matches current date
- Clears old selection if different day
- Prevents selecting yesterday's task

### ✅ localStorage Unavailable
- parseInt returns NaN for invalid data
- Safely falls back to null
- Auto-select logic takes over

### ✅ Multiple Tabs
- Each tab reads localStorage on mount
- Selection updates when switching tasks
- Last tab to change task wins (expected behavior)

### ✅ Task Completed
- Completed tasks can still be selected
- Allows reviewing completed work
- Validation doesn't filter by completion status

## Testing

### Test 1: Basic Persistence
1. Select a task (e.g., "Write docs")
2. Start timer if you want
3. Refresh page (F5)
4. ✅ Same task should be selected

### Test 2: Different Day
1. Select a task today
2. Manually change currentDate or wait until tomorrow
3. ✅ Selection should clear, auto-select first task

### Test 3: Deleted Task
1. Select a task
2. Delete it (via API or another tab)
3. Refresh page
4. ✅ Should select different task (first incomplete)

### Test 4: With Running Timer
1. Select task "Task A"
2. Start timer (e.g., 20:00)
3. Refresh page
4. ✅ Timer at ~20:00 AND task still "Task A"

## Status: ✅ LIVE

Selected task persistence is **active now**! Try it:
1. Select a task
2. Refresh the page
3. Same task stays selected! 🎯

**Combined with timer persistence**, you now have a **fully resumable workflow** that survives page refreshes! 🚀
